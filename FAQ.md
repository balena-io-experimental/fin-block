## Why the balenaFin?
We designed the balenaFin to reduce the friction that fleet owners face while building, deploying and scaling large fleets of connected devices. We’ve been working with our community and customers on thousands of use cases over the past few years, and it has become clear that scaling hardware is a problem.

The balenaFin is a Raspberry Pi Compute Module carrier board that can run all the software that the Raspberry Pi can run, but hardened for deployment in the field. Even better, it’s offered at an accessible price point relative to other professional boards.

## Why fin block?
The fin block provide a simplified interface for accessing advanced features of the balenaFin.
Currently this includes:

- Power modes
- Coprocessor Digital GPIO Reading and Writing
- Flashing the Coprocessor
- Reading manufacturing data such as serial ID and manufacturing date
- More to come!

## Which versions does this support? 
The fin block supports the balenaFin versions: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`.
