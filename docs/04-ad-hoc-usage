# Ad Hoc Usage
To make the functionality accessible outside of a balena fleet release the `balenablock/fin` image can be executed as container on a balenaFin This is needed when some functionality of this block is needed ad hoc or sporadically on devices that run an existing release. The `balenablock/fin` image can be executed by calling the balena engine command line tools on a balenaFin running balenaOS.

## Execution on Fin
From a hostOS terminal execute

```bash
balena run -d \
  --network=host \
  --privileged \
  -v fin:/data/firmware \
  -e "DEBUG=firmata,flasher,downloader,supervisor,eeprom,main" \
  -e "AUTOFLASH=1" \
  -e "AUTOCONFIG=1" \
  --name finblock \
  balenablocks/fin:latest
```
This will execute the fin block as container in the background and will provide the API on localhost port 1337.


### Requesting API 
Afterwards the API can be requested for data, for example the eeprom data.
```bash
curl -sX GET localhost:1337/eeprom
```

### Teardown
The container should be stopped and the image should be deleted:

```bash
balena stop finblock
balena container rm finblock
balena rmi balenablocks/fin:latest --force
```
