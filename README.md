**The fin block is a balenaBlock that provides flashing utilities, status tagging, sleep control and firmata control functionality of the [balenaFin](https://www.balena.io/fin/).**

## Highlights

- **Control the balenaFin's hardware**: Including the balenaFin's power modes and firmata on the coprocessor
- **Flash the balenaFin's coprocessor**: Either with our provided firmata firmware or with custom firmware
- **Retrieve manufacturing info about the balenaFin**: Access the serial ID, manufacturing date and more

## Motivation

![fin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balenablocks/fin/master/images/fin.png)

The [balenaFin](https://www.balena.io/fin/) is a Raspberry Pi Compute Module carrier board that can run all the software that the Raspberry Pi can run, but hardened for deployment in the field.
Even better, itâ€™s offered at an accessible price point relative to other professional boards.
This block allows you to easily utilise some of the more advanced features the balenaFin has to offer.

## Notes

The fin block is now maintained at balena's registry and the image can be found at `bh.cr/balenablocks/fin-block`.
The image is still maintained at Docker Hub (`balenablocks/finabler`) but will no longer be updated, so please switch to balena's registry if you wish to use the latest version.
